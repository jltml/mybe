<p><br /></p>

<p>We're a small group of highschoolers concerned about, well, pretty much everything. But particularly important to us is the health of our planet: we, as a species, are at a breaking point, and if we don't soon stop veiling the problem as one whose solution will "ruin the economy" or blowing it off as some sort of unattainable ideal or hiding it behind partisanship and conservatism… actually, that's fine for the planet. Earth will be just fine, the trees will be just fine, the oceans will eventually reset, just with one difference — people will be gone, and when humans realize they and their ancestors have messed up, they'll find that a whole lot has gone with them. People have messed up time and time again. This is our chance to do the right thing. The skies, the lakes, the oceans, the forests — none of them need us. But we need every strand of their existence.</p>
